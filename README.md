## Resources

* [MDN Document.querySelector()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelector) - I used this method as a shortcut to accessing one of the DOM nodes in creating the clickable dropdown menu.

* [MDN Element.setAttribute()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/setAttribute) - I used this method to change add and remove classes when creating the dropdown menu button.

* [CSS Tricks Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - I used this to reference the CSS properties I could set to force the menu button and the h1 to align on the cross axis of a flex container.

## Deductions

I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

## Comments

Getting some real practical experience in working with the DOM was extremely helpful in making sense of all the concepts we have learned about in class. I know from digging around in jQuery plugin codes that a lot of effects involve adding and removing classes. I'm not sure I used the best method for adding and removing classes on elements. Is there a better way to do this than the setAttribute() method?
